============================

![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/LQ8anw-4dNVNm5oTRz3doutvVgpqPwb_dli5nKxw0M1ZFG5XV-sEWMwR1cCg44aOmwipd6L82OtM5g=w1918-h1654 "Product list")

Running 
-------

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` on the command line in the root folder
3. Run `npm start`
4. The website should be up and running at http://localhost:3000
5. If products don't load shortly, you may need a CORS bypass extension. "Moesif Origin & CORS Changer" 
   for Chrome works well (you just have to install it and click the icon to enable it). 

To execute the unit tests, run `npm test`.

Future enhancements
-------------------

 * Add list sorting & filtering (would need backend support)
 * Setup routing

 * Redux could be added when the app grows more complex
