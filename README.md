Sample store / products list
============================

Running 
-------

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` on the command line in the root folder
3. Run `npm start`
4. The website should be up and running at http://localhost:3000
5. If products don't load shortly, you may need a CORS bypass extension. "Moesif Origin & CORS Changer" 
   for Chrome works well (you just have to install it and click the icon to enable it).
